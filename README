This is a comparator software for businesses/individuals that track their money in Google Sheets.
It accepts a CSV from a bank detailing the transcations, and after logging in to Google Sheets, you can select the sheets and map the respective columns the data appears in.

The google app credentials have been omitted from this commit, for obvious reasons. You'll need to put google's client_secret.json file in the directory with index.py in order to run it properly.


To Run this software, simply clone it and install dependencies.

Create an "app" with google in the (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard), and download the "secret". The app
terminates after you click "download sheets" if you do not have client_secret.json in the same directory.

This is all it takes to run.

If you want an executable, make sure to run `pyinstaller index.spec` which will generate a directory dist/index which contains all the files needed for execution.
